		<h1>Hi! Welcome to my personal website!</h1>

		<p>My name is John Redfern, and I am currently a junior in the BSI Program following the UX Design pathway. I am originally
			from Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and I found out about Michigan because my neighbors used to be professors here. I was the first
			student from my high school to ever come to college out here. In high school, I played football, baseball, golf, and basketball
			but my favorite was basketball, and I still enjoy playing pickup games with my friends or anyone who is at the gym! Oh, and I love
			to ski!

			In my free time, I enjoy any and all outdoor activities. Growing up in Lake Tahoe gave me a great appreciation for the beauty of
			nature, and it gave me a love for all things outdoors. Watersports and winter sports are my absolute favorite, and if I had the
			opportunity to move to and live in the Swiss Alps skiing all day, I'd probably take it!
		</p>
		<p>
			I've worked multiple different random jobs in my life. In Tahoe, there are many seasonal job positions only available for a part of
			the year. I worked as a golf course maintenance worker during the summer and a ski lift operator in the winter. My favorite job was
			working at a marina as a dockhand. I enjoyed it because a lot of the job involved interacting with people, and I am a social person.
			Additionally, the marina was home to many very, very nice and expensive Formula boats. I learned a pretty useful life skill in the
			ability to skillfully maneuver boats which I could use if I ever wanted to obtain a captain's license in the future.
